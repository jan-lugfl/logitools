This  file  contains  some frequently asked questions and answers
regarding G15Daemon and it's installation.

Q1.     G15daemon complains that it cant find libg15.so.1 !!

Answer:

By default, libg15 is installed in /usr/local/lib.  Some  distros
don't  look  there  for libraries by default.  There are two ways
around this - 1. add /usr/local/lib  to  /etc/ld.so.conf  (you'll
need  to  be  root  to  do this) and run ldconfig or 2. rerun the
libg15 configure script with --prefix=/usr, then make && make in-
stall.  This will install libg15 into the /usr/lib directory.


Q2.     G15daemon  complains  about  not receiving a return value
and won't run!!

Answer:

G15daemon really needs to be run by the user root.   If  you  are
already running as root, and you still see this error, please let
us know.


Q3.     My 'G' keys dont work in X11 !!

Answer:

The daemon adds new scancodes for all the G & M keys.  X11 doesnt
understand  some  of these.  In order to have the keys work in X,
you'll find an xmodmaprc script and a bash script in the  contrib
directory.  Copy the xmodmaprc file to $HOME/.Xmodmap and set the
bash script to run every time X11 starts.  KDE has  an  AutoStart
folder you can put it in, Gnome probably has something similar.
