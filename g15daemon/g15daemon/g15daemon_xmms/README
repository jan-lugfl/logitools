A very simple spectrum analyser for xmms.  Due to the lack of refresh speed
of the G15's lcd, refresh rate is limited to 5fps.

Probably has numerous bugs, and it certainly isnt synced to the music, but it was an interesting exercise.
Improvements and patches are welcome.

To compile, install the g15daemon, then come back to this directory and type
make, make install.  you're done.
