G15message:

A simple message/alert tool for g15daemon and the Logitech G15.
By default (with no additional options) it will display the text on the
commandline for 5seconds, then exit.

Requires libg15render devel package to compile.

Usage:

To display a simple alert, with a title, which closes after 5 seconds:
$ g15message -t "My Title" "this is my message"

To center messagetext:
$ g15message -c -t "My Title" "This is my centered message.  It will be centered regardless of length."

To display an alert which remains for 15 seconds  (default is to timeout after 5 seconds):
$ g15message -d 15 -t "My Title" "This is my message.."

To display an alert requiring a button press:
$ g15message -o "this message requires that you click Ok"

To display an alert message with a title that requires either a Yes or No response:
$ g15message -y -t "My Title" "Please press Yes or No.  Is this simple to use?"

g15message will return either 1 or 0, depending on whether Yes or No was
clicked. 

To display an alert which is always on top - the user cannot switch away
until the question is answered:
$ g15message -y -f -t "My Title" "You must answer Yes or No to this question
- no other client can be seen until you do."
