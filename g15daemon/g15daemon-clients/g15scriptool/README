G15ScripTool is a simple shellscript helper.  It's commands are BASIC-like,
and quite simple to read.

Most commands follow the same arguments as libg15render's versions.

g15new: 	start a new screen
g15print: 	output text
g15bar:		draw a percentage bar
g15line:	draw a line between two points
g15box:		draw a box, optionally filled with a colour.
g15circle:	draw a circle, optionally filled with a colour.
g15clear:	clear screen.
g15roundbox:	draw a box with rounded corners, optionally filled with a colour.
g15setpixel:	draw a single pixel in specified colour.
g15flush:	write the buffer to the LCD
g15quit: 	exit screen

A simple example can be found in test.sh in this directory, here is a snippet:

#!/bin/sh
g15new
g15print "percentage bar",0,1,1,1,i
for i in `seq 1 10`; do
	g15bar 1,20,160,30,1,$i,10,0
	g15flush
	sleep .2
done
g15flush
sleep 1
g15quit

BUGS:
There are probably plenty. 

TODO:
- Write documentation
- Add truetype font support
- Add ability to receive keypresses
- Add wbmp support for splash screens etc.
