This is the starting point of g15daemon 2.0.  It's a work in progress,
partially functional (it already does most of the stuff the previous version
did), and incredibly untidy...

This is simply here to test and stabilise the API of what will become 2.0

FEATURES:
- True Plugins 
- Synchronous Event-based architecture.
- Mostly backward-compatible with versions 1.0 & 1.2.* via the LCDServer plugin.
- 

If you want to write a plugin, please see some examples in the plugin
folder.  If the current plugin API doesn't do something you think it should,
let us know, it's never too late to change.

TODO:
- re-write most of it, currently it's simply the old code modified to suit
the new architecture, and the new stuff is not much better...
- tidy up the code
- write some updated documentation
- write some plugins!
- write some more documentation and plugins...
- add config options to a configuration file..
- add menu functionality to the clock for plugin/g15daemon configuration
- ???
