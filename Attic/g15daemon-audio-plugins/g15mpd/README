G15mpd:

A simple frontend for the MPD Media Player Daemon, for use with g15daemon.

Requires X11, libg15render, and libmpd to compile.

Features:
- Artist/Title Info is displayed
- Track time elapsed/total time is displayed, with a completion bar.
- Random and Repeat modes are available.
- Multimedia keys are usable when run from X.

Caveats:
- Requires MPD to be running in the background.  
- In order for multimedia keys to function, the frontend must be run from
  X11, either in a console, or at X login.
- Requires that X11 has been configured to understand the mediakeys, either
  via the g15daemon xmodmap file, or a similar keyboard being selected in X
  configuration.
- Currently, playlist management is not available, so another mpd frontend will be required to create
  one.
