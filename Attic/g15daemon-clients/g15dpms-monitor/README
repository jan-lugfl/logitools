G15dpms-monitor:

A simple 'screensaver' tool for g15daemon and the Logitech G15.

The tool simply waits in the background for the monitor to be put into
standby by a screensaver via DPMS.  When this happens, it turns all the keyboard
lights off, restoring them when the monitor re-activates.


USAGE:

Without any commandline options, g15dpms-monitor will simply wait for DPMS
to become activated (forcing the monitor into standby mode), and switch off keyboard lights.

When using the --cmd-enable <program> commandline option, g15dpms-monitor will run the
specified program when the monitor goes into Standby mode.  

When --cmd-disable <program> is used, the program specified will be run when
the monitor re-activates.
