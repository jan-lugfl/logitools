Readme for G15Tailf and G15Term 
************************************************************************
G15Tailf:

G15tailf is a simple G15Daemon client that outputs the last 6 lines of a
file and writes it's output on the G15's LCD.  It watches the file for
changes and updates automatically.

It works in the same way as the GNU tailf command.

The output can be scrolled horizontally via the rectangular "L" keys
below the LCD.

Options:
There are two options:
-t "Screen Title" displays "Screen Title" at the top of each screen
-d puts g15tailf into the background as a daemon.

g15tailf -t "Message Log" /var/log/messages

Buttons:
L2-L3 - scroll left and right

***********************************************************************
G15Term:

G15Term is a client that runs just about any console application
and writes it's output on the G15's LCD.

Currently, there is no redirection of STDIN, so commands that expect input
will not work unless g15term is run from a terminal, and no redirection of
STDERR. 

It's main goal is to simplify the creation of mini-clients
such as network and cpu stats etc.  Any script or program that outputs
interesting information can be displayed on the G15 with little or no effort. Tools that
print output then exit immediately are probably best run via a script which calls
them repeatedly.

The output can be scrolled horizontally and vertically via the rectangular "L" keys
below the LCD.

Options:
When run with the '-r' option, the cmd is run repeatedly, which is nice for
things like 'date' and 'ls' that exit immediately.

Buttons:
L1 - Exits when held down for longer than .5seconds.
L2-L3 - scroll left and right
L4-L5 - scroll up and down

BUGS:
There are probably plenty.
