This is the second release of libg15render.  I separated most of this code from
g15composer so that I could reuse it in a lcdproc driver for the g15 that I was
trying to develop.  Now that this library is out, the lcdproc driver should soon
follow.  G15composer, a simple, scriptable command interface to libg15render
should also soon be released.
