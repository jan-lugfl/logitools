This is a patch against lcdproc CVS HEAD.  Apply the patch and configure with 
--enable-drivers=g15.  This driver requires g15daemon-1.2 and libg15render.  
This driver is nearly feature complete, and will soon be submitted for 
inclusion in lcdproc.

The Keymap is as follows:

Escape = G1
Enter  = L1
Left   = L2
Up     = L3
Down   = L4
Right  = L5
