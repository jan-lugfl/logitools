Examples:

nohup ./g15composer /path/to/pipe &

1) echo 'TL "Hello" "World"' > /path/to/pipe

2) cat instructions > /path/to/pipe

3) ./some_script > /path/to/pipe
     where some_script is a bash, Perl, etc. script or application which outputs
     one or more of the commands listed below.

FIFO handling has changed as of g15composer-2.1.  /path/to/pipe should not exist when starting g15composer or when creating a 
new screen with the SN command.  G15composer will exit or refuse to create a new screen if /path/to/pipe exists.  You should 
check for its existence before opening a screen in any script.

Note also that the color value is no longer optional for any command.  It must always be specified.

*** Text Commands:

Ts "line 1" "line 2" ...
   where s is the size of the font (S, M and L are supported).
   To insert a double-quote, prefix it with a backslash

TO X Y S F "line 1" "line 2" ... 
   Overlays text of the given size at (X,Y)
   Text will be centered if F=1 and right justified if F=2

*** Font Command: (NB., g15composer must be configured with --enable-ttf to use font commands)

FL F S "/path/to/font" 
   Loads a font into Face Slot F with size S.

FP F S X Y Co Ce "line 1" "line 2" ...
   Prints text using the font is Slot F with size S at position (X,Y).
   Text will be printed in color Co and will be centered if Ce=1.
   
*** Pixel Commands:

PO X Y W H "100101101..." 
   Overlays a pixel image of the given Width and Height at (X,Y)
   The last argument must now be passed as a quoted string.  This is a change from previous behavior.

PS X Y C
   Sets the pixel at (X,Y) to color C (0 or 1)
   
PC 0|1
   Clears the screen and fills it with 0|1

PF X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C
   Fills the area from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) with color C

PR X1 Y1 X2 Y2
   Reverses the pixels from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2)

PB X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C T F
   Draws a box from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) using color C and thickness T, filling if F=1
   T, and F are optional, but if specified must be specified in order, i.e., you must set T to set F
   Defaults are T=1, and F=0

*** Drawing Commands:

DL X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C
   Draws a line from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) using color C

DC X Y R C F 
   Draws a circle centered at (X,Y) with radius R using color C, filling if F=1
   F is optional and defaults to F=0
   Note that the syntax has changed, the position of C and F has been swapped
   
DR X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C F 
   Draws a rounded box from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) using color C, filling if F=1
   F is optional and defaults to F=0
   Note that the syntax has changed, the position of C and F has been swapped
   
DB X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C N M T
   Draws a percentage or progress bar from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2) using color C
   The bar will be filled with N units out of M
   T sets the type of the bar, valid values are 1, 2, or 3
   T is optional and defaults to T=1

DN X1 Y1 X2 Y2 C N
   Draws a big number N in the area bounded by (X1,Y2) and (X2,Y2) using color C

DI B X Y
   Draws a WBMP icon from buffer B at (X,Y)

DS B X Y W H OX OY
   Draws a WBMP sprite from buffer B at (X,Y) with size WxH
   Sprite is drawn from buffer offset by (OX,OY)

*** WBMP Commands:

WS "/path/to/image"
   Loads a WBMP image from /path/to/image and displays it on the screen
   Image must be 160x43 as it is loaded directly into the LCD buffer
   
WL B "/path/to/image"
   Loads a WBMP image from /path/to/image into buffer number B

*** Mode Commands:

MC 0|1
   Turns caching off or on, i.e. the changes are not immediately sent to the 
   LCD if caching is on (MC 1). Changes will be sent on the next MC 0.

MX 0|1
   Sets succeeding pixel colors to normal, or XORed with existing pixels.
   Good for drawing sprites with MC: 
      MC 1, draw, MC 0
      MC 1, redraw in original position and draw elsewhere, MC 0

   Old   New   Current   Redraw
    0     0     0^0 = 0   0^0 = 0
    0     1     0^1 = 1   1^1 = 0
    1     0     1^0 = 1   1^0 = 1
    1     1     1^1 = 0   0^1 = 1

MR 0|1
   Set succeeding pixel colors to normal, or reversed
   
MP 0|1|2
   Set screen to foreground if 0 and background if 1
   If 2, set screen to background if and only if user hasn't set it to foreground

*** Screen Commands:

SN "/path/to/pipe"
   Create a new G15Comopser instance reading from /path/to/pipe

SC
   Close the current screen.  Closing the initial screen will close all other screens

----------------------

The following commands are relayed to g15daemon:

*** LCD Commands:

LB 0|1|2
   Sets the LCD brightness level

LC 0|1|2
   Sets the LCD contrast level


*** Keyboard/LED Commands:

KL 0|1|2
   Sets LED mode: 0=app-controlled 1=normal 2=sticky.
   Not currently implemented.

KM x 0|1
   Sets the Mx-light off or on. x=0,1,2,3 where 0 is all M-lights (minus MR).
   Only has an effect if KL is set to 0.
