This is a library to render text and shapes into a buffer usable by the 
Logitech G15 Gaming Keyboard.
This library probably isn't very useful without libg15 and/or g15daemon.

Font support is now provided by FreeType2.  If you want font support, provide 
the --enable-ttf option to configure.  For font support in applications, you
must #define TTF_SUPPORT 1 before including libg15render.h and add
`freetype-config --cflags` to your $CFLAGS.
