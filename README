logitools
==============================================================================================

This repo contains a modified version of the g15tools. As I feel the upstream is being slow at
bugfixes and new inclusions I forked it off. One of the biggest changes is better G510 support
when I obtain a G510 Keyboard and to also support the G110's Macro Keys by adding checks to
the LCD screen to know if its a LCD specific keyboard.

Planned Features
* Rename to logitools as it fits more then g15tools as it supports more then just the G15
  Keyboard. This will rename the following

    libg15 -> liblogitech
    g15daemon -> logitoolsd

* Adding better G510 support.
* Adding support to other Logitech Keyboards that have macro recording support, even if they
  don't have LCD Screens.
* No Longer use autotools (This is a personal preference, I have a huge huge dislike for
  autotools and wishes everyone would just ditch it. Its not cause its a GNU project, 
  its just the worse poorly written software and is a pain to maintain projects using it.)

I might also add mouse support for the G500 as it has programmable keys as well for macros,
tho this is just a planned addition.

==============================================================================================
NOTE: The Attic just contains code I have not converted to CMake or renamed things or added
      new code. Mostly anything here will not build at all.
